Algorithm - 1(Pseudo code)
1. Start
2. Declaring a variable(highestMarks) of type double. Having an initial value of ArrayListIndex[0]
   Double highestMarks = studentMarks.get(0);

3. Declaring a variable(highestMarks) of type double. Having an initial value of ArrayListIndex[0]
   Double lowestMarks = studentMarks.get(0);
4. For loop starts here.
    if (highestMarks < studentMarks.get(i)) {
        highestMarks = studentMarks.get(i);
    }
    if (lowestMarks > studentMarks.get(i)) {
        lowestMarks = studentMarks.get(i);
    }
5. For loop ends.
6. Print highest and lowest marks.
7. Stop.

Algorithm -2(Pseudo code)
Mean logic.
1. Start
2. Declaring a variable(total) of type double. Having an initial value of 0.0.
3. For loop starts here.
    for (int i = 0; i < studentMarks.size(); i++) {
                total += studentMarks.get(i);
            }
4. Declaring a mean logic.
    double mean = total / studentMarks.size();
5. Print mean value.
6. Stop.

Standard Deviation logic.
1. Start
2. Declaring a variable(summation) of type double. Having an initial value of 0.0.
3 For loop starts here.
 for (int i = 0; i < studentMarks.size(); i++) {
            double intermediateValue = Math.pow((studentMarks.get(i) - mean), 2);
            summation += intermediateValue;
        }
4. Declaring a variable(divisor) of type int. It holds total number of students - 1
    int divisor = studentMarks.size() - 1;
5. Declaring a variable(nextIntermediateValue) of type double. It holds summation by divisor value.
    double nextIntermediateValue = summation / divisor;
6. Entering the square root of the intermediateValue.
    Math.pow(nextIntermediateValue, 0.5)
7. Stop.
